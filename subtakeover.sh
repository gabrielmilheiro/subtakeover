# You can use this tool to search for subdomains.
# I created it to use as my own tool to find Subdomain Takeover
# vulnerabilities.
# You might are asking yourself "how can I use it to do that?".
# Let me explain. It will search for subdomains and will it will filter the
# alias row by row. When we find something dealing with clouds, we can
# test the Subdomain Takeover attack.
